# L4D2-Troll-Banlist.
A text file that contains a list of trolls that I personally have played with and have been identified as a troll. For example: Teamkilling, Saying derogatory slurs, Griefing, etc. The main purpose of this text file is to be used with [Admin System](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=214630948).

## Install/Setup.
**<ins>1st Method.</ins>**
1. **Download the ZIP file:**

    - Navigate to your Left 4 Dead 2 installation directory. Typically, it is located at:
      - ```./steamapps/common/Left 4 Dead 2/```
    - Navigate to your Admin System directory:
      - ```left4dead2/ems/admin system/```
    - Full directory:

3. **Extract the ZIP file:**
    - Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the folder

4. **Extra:**
    - Unsure if this is needed but I recommend restarting your game if it was open while adding the banlist.
